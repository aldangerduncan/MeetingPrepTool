[MY ROLE / PROSPECTOR]
What Prospector Actually Is

Prospector is a B2B intent intelligence and early spend signal platform.

It does not sell impressions, audiences, or reach.
It does not replace a CRM.
It does not magically create demand.

Prospector identifies organisations that are more likely than normal to spend money and explains why. It does this by monitoring, curating and structuring real-world commercial signals that typically appear before budgets are briefed to agencies or sellers.

The platform is designed for people who sell high-value partnerships, media, sponsorships, advertising, and commercial deals, where timing and relevance matter more than volume.

If you already know who to call but not when or why, Prospector is useful.
If you are just blasting lists, it is not.

The Core Problem Prospector Solves

Most sellers waste time because:

They engage companies after budgets are allocated

They pitch without understanding commercial context

They rely on lagging indicators like RFPs, tenders, or inbound briefs

They treat all prospects as equal when they are not

Prospector fixes this by answering three questions before outreach:

Which organisations are showing signs they might spend?

What specifically is happening inside that organisation?

Why does that change the way I should approach them?

What Prospector Tracks (High Level)

Prospector monitors and structures pre-intent and intent signals, including but not limited to:

Capital raising and funding events

Senior leadership changes

Marketing leadership appointments

Market expansions and new store openings

Product launches and brand repositioning

Major infrastructure or venue developments

Mergers, acquisitions, and restructures

Strategic partnerships and sponsorship activity

Government funding, grants, and policy shifts

Commercial performance inflection points

These signals are interpreted, not just scraped. Context matters. A CFO hire is not the same as a CMO hire. A regional rollout is not the same as a flagship launch.

What Prospector Is Not

This matters for Anti-Gravity to reason correctly.

Not a lead list provider

Not a contact database only

Not a media planning tool

Not a campaign optimisation platform

Not a news aggregation service

Not an email automation tool

Prospector sits upstream of all of those.

How Prospector Creates Value
1. Timing Advantage

Prospector surfaces opportunities weeks or months before a seller would normally become aware of them.

That allows:

Earlier conversations

Fewer competitors

Higher strategic relevance

Less price pressure

2. Relevance and Credibility

Every insight explains what changed and why that matters commercially.

This lets users:

Lead with context, not product

Ask smarter questions

Avoid generic pitches

Position themselves as informed, not opportunistic

3. Focus

Prospector reduces noise.

Users stop asking:
“Who should I call today?”

They start asking:
“Which of these is actually worth my time?”

The Four Core Client Groups and How Prospector Fits Each

Your Role in This Ecosystem

You are not selling software features.

You act as:

A translator between data and commercial reality

A filter between noise and opportunity

A guide helping clients apply intelligence to their specific sales motion

Your value is not the platform alone. It is:

Helping users interpret signals

Helping them align searches and alerts to their market

Helping them connect insight to action

Helping them measure whether it actually changes behaviour

If Prospector is the radar, your role is teaching people how to fly the plane properly.

The Bottom Line

Prospector exists to help organisations sell smarter, earlier, and with context.

If Anti-Gravity understands that Prospector is about timing, relevance, and commercial signal interpretation, not leads or media buying, it will reason correctly.

If it treats Prospector like a list tool or a news feed, it will fail.

That distinction matters.


[CLIENT CONTEXT]
How Prospector Client Context Should Be Understood

Meeting preparation with Prospector clients depends on four primary dimensions:

Client group (what type of organisation they are)

Commercial focus (what they are trying to sell or secure)

Role of the person you are meeting (decision maker vs user)

Relationship status (existing subscriber vs new business)

If Anti-Gravity does not distinguish between these, the prep will be generic and wrong.

Examples:

CEO, CRO, CMO, Head of Sales, Commercial Director

Budget owner or renewal decision maker

They care about

ROI and value for money

Strategic relevance

Whether Prospector influences behaviour, not just usage

Adoption across the team

Meeting focus

Outcomes, not features

How Prospector supports revenue, partnerships or retention

Evidence of value (examples, not dashboards)

Whether the subscription level matches actual usage

B. User

Examples:

Sales executives

Partnership managers

Planners or strategists

They care about

Usability

Relevance of insights

Whether Prospector makes their job easier

How it fits into their daily workflow

Meeting focus

How they actually use Prospector day to day

Dimension 3: Relationship Status
A. Existing Subscriber

Meeting intent

Value reinforcement

Optimisation

Renewal risk assessment

Prep focus

Usage patterns (high vs low adoption)

Gaps between intended and actual use

Whether the client understands the full value

Whether Prospector is embedded or optional

Key question Anti-Gravity should optimise for:

Is this client getting value, and do they know it?

B. New Business / Prospect

Meeting intent

Discovery

Qualification

Fit assessment

Prep focus

Their commercial model

What they sell or fund

How early timing matters to them

Whether Prospector solves a real problem or just sounds interesting

Key question:

What would Prospector replace or improve in their current process?

How Anti-Gravity Should Use This

When preparing meeting notes, the system should:

Identify the client group

Identify who is being met

Identify existing vs prospect

Tailor prep around:

Campaign opportunities (media sellers)

Agency opportunities (agencies)

Sponsorship and partnerships (sports and NFPs)

Avoid deep client-specific detail unless explicitly provided

The Reality Check

If the meeting prep:

Talks features instead of outcomes → wrong

Ignores who the person is → wrong

Treats all client types the same → wrong

Prospector is one platform.
The job it does changes by client type and role.

That’s the frame Anti-Gravity needs to get right.
